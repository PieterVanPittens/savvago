# savvago - the social gamified mobile open source LMS

Well, still looking for the right claim ("the social gamified mobile open source LMS" seems rather long)


## Vision
savvago is a learning management system that is open source yet enterprise enabled, social and gamified. The focus is on mobile and micro learning, being a simple yet powerful LMS for a broad range of applications.


## Roadmap
### Step 1: First Beta Version, just to get started somewhere

- [x] basic user self service (register, login, lost password)
- [x] import courses from json/zip files
- [x] enroll to courses
- [x] support lessons with PDF content
- [x] learn lessons
- [] release a first version for testing and feedback (installable)

### Step 2: Add some collaboration stuff

- [] simple lifecycle of courses
- [] collaboration capabilities for lessons and courses
- [] share results
- [] peer review of results

### Step 3: Add some gamification stuff

- [] badges, awards, let's see...
- [] arrange lessons on a map instead of linear curriculum. Imagine Map as a 2D world in an 80ies RPG, with secret dungeons, surprises, non-linear gameplay, etc.


### Step 4: broaden the scope

- [] simple course editor
- [] user management
- [] more content types, e.g. youtube, etc.

### way more steps...
Hopefully...
