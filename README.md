# savvago - you savvy?


## What?
savvago is the new open source learning management system.
The journey has just begun...

## Why?
Good question. It feels like there are already millions of LMS out there. It also feels like there is a need for an LMS with a unique set of properties:
* Open Source
* more corporate than academic
* mobile first
* as simple as possible

## How?
savvago is based on PHP/MySQL

## Who?
At the moment it's just me, Pieter.
The journey has just begun, so who wants to join?
